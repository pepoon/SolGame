        //        observers that need to get the destroyed message
        //     3. RebuildAfterUnspawn to remove it
        //     4. then remove the Entity from connection's owned objects, which
        //        IS NOT POSSIBLE anymore because the connection was already
        //        removed. which means that the next rebuild would still see it
